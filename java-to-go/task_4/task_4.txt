4) You have a list of integers (simulating data points from a sensor) and you want to process each one (for example square it) concurrently.

Create a simple program that:

- starts several goroutines to do concurrent tasks,
- uses buffered channel,
- uses defer to log when each task is finished.

-------------------------------------

- handles work in parallel (concurrent task execution)
- channel - communication between goroutines
- defer - cleans up per-task (or globally) — closes the channel safely
- buffered channel - prevents blocking when sending if receiver isn’t ready
